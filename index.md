## Front Page

This is Prose and Prosody, a serial fiction website housing the
stories of Christopher Rodriguez. There are currently 11 different
storylines going on, with updates set for Friday of each week.

[Here is a link to the most recent piece!][link] 

The first entry in the "Incandescent Shock" series: Three young
space-colonists have finally graduated from their schooling and are
set to begin exploring the planet around their small colony. What they
find shocks them, but what they *don't* find shocks them even more.

If You are looking for more information about this site, check the
links to the left (especially the Story Code link; That explains the
guiding principles of the work I do here, so it might help if You read
that.)

If You are looking some of the other things I do, check out my
[homepage][cdr255]! It's where I catalog most of the things I've
published in one way or another, and is most likely to have what You
are looking for. And if You are just looking for some more
editorial-style stuff (bending towards technical at times), I have a
[blog][toft]!

I'm also currently actively working on the design of this site, so
expect things to change slightly (don't worry, I will *not* be
breaking any permalinks, should You choose to bookmark/bitly
something). If You are interested in Jekyll themes, the git repo for
this one is [here][lycorma]. I've only made it recently, and it's
pretty basic, but feel free to check it out.
