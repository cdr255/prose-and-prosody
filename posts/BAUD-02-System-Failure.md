*For me... And for them.*

The pictures of their death were burned into Shera's mind. That
distinguished face, the face she'd only ever seen before in pictures
and vids, with eyes open in frozen terror, drenched in long dried
blood. A horrific way to pass away, and one none on the L3W15 should
ever have to experience (as they told her numerous times through the
course of the trial). It was only through a few accidental glances
that she'd really looked at the photo; The blood alone made her sick
to her stomach.

But then, the son's death was so much worse. His...

The dreadful images vanished from her mind when a loud mechanical
"KA-CHUNK!" sounded through the vents. The lights around her flared
for a moment, and then dimmed greatly. The haze of orange fire-like
force-field faded slightly, and then began to flicker.

Shera herself had had her eyes fixed to the vent since the noise
began, but now began to look around. "A power failure?" She asked the
fan, listening closely to be sure it was still running.

It was.

"What's going on?" She said. A power failure would normally make the
parts of the ship affected switch to an emergency generator within
seconds, restoring the lights and other amenities people depended on
for daily life. Sure, things like the vids and games and stuff might
be out for a while, but the *lights* certainly wouldn't stay dim for
so long. In fact, the only thing that should have shut off in her cell
is...

*The screen...* Shera thought, turning to gaze at the blank wall
 across from her cell... Except, it wasn't blank. Where bright,
 unfeeling digits had mockingly counted down her final moments a few
 seconds ago, there was now an address: "SCR3-4MY". A maintenance room
 one block over from her cell, SCR3-3CH... Shera had been there as
 recently as last week, for one thing or another.

*Why...?* she was apprehensively staring at the screen, lost in
 thought, when two things happened. First, the address disappeared,
 replaced by a big, bright orange, blinking arrow pointing down a hall
 to the left.

Second, footsteps started echoing from the other direction.

Her body seemed to react without her telling it: Her arms shaking
themselves out and her legs rocking her back and forth like the
runners from various sporting events she'd seen over the years. Her
sweating palms covered themselves up as she balled her hands into
fists, the metal ring on her right arm digging into the back of her
hand as much as her nails dug into the front.

She counted the flickers of the force-field in front of her. Catching
it at its weakest was very important: Going through the force-field
when it was fully powered was enough to kill a person. Her left hand
still throbbed from when it had grazed the field before... That was
off-rhythm, though, so she pushed it from her
mind.

"On... Off... On... On... Off..." Her voice barely audible over her
heightened breathing, even to her. The footsteps had stopped, and were
replaced with muffled voices and the occasional buzz of a locked door
rejecting a key. As she chanted the rhythm of the flickering
force-field to herself, her arms and legs began following suit: Tensing
every time the force-field dimmed, releasing well before it flickered
bright again.

*It's now or never, Shera!*

As the field flickered again to its dimmer state, she pushed off with
her right foot. Her arms crossed in front of her face, she dove head
first through the orange haze. As she did, she felt some fraction of
the full current of the force-field- *54 amps, the same number as a
deck of cards,* she remembered in that split moment- pass through each
part of her body as it sailed through it. It was like slowly passing
her skin through an open flame, but while her whole body had pins and
needles.

It was the second most painful experience of her life. She fell to the
ground, her breath caught in her throat, her muscles convulsing in
spasms of pain and cramping variably. A silent plea: *Please let me be
all of the way through!*

She lied there for a few more moments, the cramps and spasms gradually
lessening as more time passed. She was reminded of the first night she
got really drunk... Or rather, the morning after. When her head felt
like a rotten egg sandwiched between to cogs, ready to burst at any
moment. Only now, her whole body felt that way.

Standing was difficult, but she made it happen. With her first step,
disorientation won out and she vomited up some red-tinged bile. After
that, the world stopped spinning quite so rapidly, and she remembered
where she was... And where she was going.

With a final look at the blinking arrow, she sped (or at least, walked
swiftly) down the hall towards room 4MY.
