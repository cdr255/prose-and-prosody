<pre>
She sat back in the coach, having traveled so far,
across hills made of snow and of grass and of mud.
From her home in the North, in this rickety car.

In the interest of trade, they had come seeking char:
Something they seemed to call those who carried the blood.
She sat back in the coach, having traveled so far.

With a smile they approached, speaking words so bizarre
Their thick tongues weaving tales of a torrential flood
from her home in the North. In this rickety car,

She was told she'd become family to the Tsar.
And because she was Kun, to avoid shedding blood,
She sat back in the coach, having traveled so far.

It was called "the Foster", she was the polar star
In her place would be some royal boy come to bud
from her home in the north, in this rickety car.

She had hoped there were reasons she went: And there are.
She was bold to check glass in the Land of the Mud.
She sat back in the coach, having traveled so far
from her home in the North in this rickety car.
