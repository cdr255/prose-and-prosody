She could feel their eyes burning into her back as the great clamor
faded into silence.

Her first thought was how cold the metal bar still felt against her
burning hot skin. Knelt over as she was, she could only see the bar as
it stretched off into the distance, easily miles before it turned to
the left and out of her sight. The heat filling her cheeks had long
since flushed them red, but was no match for such a long piece of
iron.

Her second thought was how strong the wind which had just blown
against her back had been. She had barely noticed it while it rushed
over her, perhaps her mind had been elsewhere (or at least preoccupied
with other things; it most certainly still rested between her
pink-stained ears)... But with it gone, she was grossly aware of just
how hot the mid day sun could be on her shoulders and back.

Her third thought: Time to get up.

Her hands slowly but firmly grasped the bar at her cheek, and with one
determined motion she pushed herself up to her knees. In the corner of
her eye, she caught sight of it: A monstrously large beast of pure
iron, smoke still billowing out of its top even from its now-halted
position. And for that moment, gazing upon it was all that
mattered. Together, they'd shared something irrevocably special,
something that might have changed it, and could easily have changed
her forever. The momentously monumental moment washed over both of
them, in her mind...

And then the others began to speak.

Those who looked more like her, those who were smaller, softer,
hairier, and much more vocal. Those who weren't tied to a line of
metal and wood, but chose where to go as they pleased, even if they
often squandered that freedom. Those who would never in their wildest
fancies attempt what she had just done, regardless of the debt they
had or the moments they'd share with anything.

The first among them climbed down from the back of that great iron
creature, which was now helpless to stop them. They began their
blathering long before she had a hope of understanding them, but she
rose to her feet anyway. To her right, about five minutes away, she
noticed more of them hopping the old, wooden fence. A slight smile
sprouted under her face: She'd had to do the same about half an hour
ago, just to get here.

*There'll be no moments for any of You,* she thought, as she pruned
that smile before it reached her lips.. *Should have been here
earlier.*

"What in the hells do you think You are doing!?" A rough, soot filled
voice brought her back to those closer by. "Do You even know You could
have died there!?" He was angry, that much was certain, but why? She
was unharmed, his charge was unharmed, there were no casualties
today. "I almost ran You over!" He turns to the smaller one at his
side. "We were going 99, with 16 tons of freight behind us. If You
hadn't'a spotted her when You did, we'd all be up shit's creek with
this one... *Especially* this one!"

The shorter one's voice spoke with less soot, and much more
gravel. "Lady, We've put in a call to the authorities. Do You have any
reason we shouldn't lock You up right now?"

She, however, did not speak. She pointed to her cheeks, and looked at
the ground in silence. Soon, the constabulary arrived, who rephrased
the short one's question, asking for a repeat performance. She happily
complied, and waited for them to finish questioning the others.

She was then handcuffed, carted around a bit, and put in a cell in the
local jail until they could figure out what to do with her.
