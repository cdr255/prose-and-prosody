<pre>
The truth
Must lie in wait
Just outside of her sphere
If she could reach out and touch it,
Gently drawing it closer to herself,
(As she would touch the one she loved)
Dorisha might return.
And then she'd know
The Truth.

And then
She would soon learn:
Wanting was well and good.
But to make something come to pass,
Especially something others denied,
was much more involved for one who
stood alone, by herself,
Except for now
And then.

One day...
of long train rides...
Went much deeper than that.
From home, Leebrook, to Kediton,
The capitol, she was within a throng
of commuters without faces.
She'd followed all the rules,
But it still took
One day.

She felt
That each person
she met could see her plan:
Peeling back Kedishire's Curtains,
Exposing themselves to the open air...
And this included her as well.
In her mind, they could see
Her flaws... and how
She felt.

At last,
The final stop.
The cool Kediton night
Brushed her flushed-brown skin. Tomorrow,
She'd expose something that no one dared see.
Tonight she found a small hotel,
Excitedly degaussed,
And fell asleep,
At last.

The truth
She would soon learn
Went much deeper than that.
Peeling back Kedishire's Curtains
She'd expose something that no one dared see.
And this included her as well.
She'd followed all the rules,
Except for now...
The truth.
