<pre>
Before
I leave my home,
I want to let You know
The sorrow I'll be leaving in
My place.

It's true
I saw the truth
Of work within these halls
When I was young and full of hope
And joy.

Although
It seemed to solve
The problems that we faced
The cost was far too great for us
To bear.

And now
I see a worth
In every face I'd shorn
With such monastic zeal... we should
have stopped.

I weep
As I recall
How we would stoke the fire
With living kindling... People... that
Have died

Before
I saw the truth:
The problems that we faced
with such monastic zeal.. we should
have died.
