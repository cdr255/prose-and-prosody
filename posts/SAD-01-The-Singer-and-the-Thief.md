Metallic notes weaved their way around the crowd gathered by the
fountain, engulfing every ear present to the fullest extent.

Their source was a young man, perched precariously on the rim of the
fountain. He seemed young, but fully grown: his bark-like brown hair
was tied behind is head in a loose knot, stubble dusted his chin
and cheeks, and he looked around the crowd with azure eyes washed in
the thick glow of attention. His clothes were not memorable or insteresting,
but in his hands was something remarkable indeed.

Carved from a single log of some sort of rare wood, with a canvas of
some kind stretched over a hoop at the bottom, the instrument dwarfed
the man who held it. Five thick, metal stings shone brightly beneath
his palm as he played. His thumb anchored the rest of his hand to the
smallest of the strings, a string which only climbed half of the way
up and ended short of the others at the top. His fingernails did most
of the playing, as he dragged their backs across the full set of
strings to strum.

On top of that ferric tapestry floated a deep voice, recalling the
past trials of a forgotten Lady: Her climb through the Merkatol
Mountains to the South, her narrow escape from an ambush of bandits,
leading up to the final confrontation with her brother, the
bandit-king, who had been kidnapping merchants as they passed through
towards her town. He admitted it freely, and demanded a portion of the
trade profits she saw, or else her merchants might never be safe
again.

The battle between them was raging, and each and every open ear was
enthralled by the story as it progressed. Each and every ear, that is,
save for two small ears, covered by a large, white hood with beads
hanging down from it's brim.

The owner of these ears was wearing a Theorin Cowl- religious garb,
marking those who had given up their earthly possessions and taken to
the earth itself for their livelyhood. They are white at the outset,
and through labor and toil (and acres of soil) it would be kept until
it was brown as the earth which they worshipped and worked with.

This one was almost purely white, and were it not for the beaded hood,
could almost be mistaken for any number of different outfits common to
the Summer streets. By design, it seemed, it was inconspicuously
conspicuous, and difficult to describe.

It's owner, the owner of the ears mentioned before, was not at all
interested in the battle being fought in the minds of the
crowd. Instead, they were playing their own trade against the
distracted audience, cutting purses and bumping bags, the contents
disappearing beneath the flowing folds of that heavy robe.

Here went some produce, there, a stream of silver, and now a ring
dropped from some unlucky finger as it grasped at its lover's
arm. Once safely secured beneath the robe, it and its owner would move
away: quickly, quietly, and curiously investigating some other section
of the crowd, or the square.

It was going well for them both, the singer and the theif, when two
things happened to occur at once: One, the singer tripped off of his
perch, stopping his playing to save that beautiful instrument from
harm. And two, a man decided to tip the storyteller just as a knife
was put to his purse.

The uproar that followed was very loud and intense, and it seemed as
though the bandit king would live to see another day, as the crowd had
found a bandit of their own to chase, and no longer remembered that
there was a musician there, at all.
