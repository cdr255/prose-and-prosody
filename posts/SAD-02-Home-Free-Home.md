Running quickly through the silty Summer streets of the city, trailing
a mob of be-robbed and vengeful music lovers behind, Rannu realized
that a more conventional thought for her to have might be something
along the lines of:

*I hope I make it out of this alive!*

This made a small smirk paint itself across her face, briefly... Until
another thought supplanted it, the one which was organically in her
head once again after one of Baje's "performances":

*I can't believe he blew it _again_!*

She darted past this cart and down that alley, up over the garden wall
and through the milling, self-involved people who frequented it.  The
flowing robes and wide sleeves of her Theoran cowl belied the grace
and poise she'd worked so hard to cultivate: Another reason she chose
it, aside from the fact that it hid her face so well.

Rannu stopped short, the heavy, wooden beads of that hood softly
smacking into her cheeks (and rattling their scorn with her for
stopping): A huge caravan had blocked off this entire road, into the
alleys to either side. She took the opportunity to honor both those
who got her here (Baje) and those who were looking to guide her
through the future (The Mob and Caravan): She reared back, flipping
the beads out of her way, and spat hard on the ground next to her.

She then brought her right leg around, tracing a semi-circle *outside*
of the spit, and *spun* herself underneath the wagon in front of her,
grasping on to its bottom. Her confident smirk reemerged, firmly
painting itself on her face as she began to climb underneath the
wagon, towards the left alleyway.

She silently thanked Feju, who'd taught her that spitting trick years
ago. *May you rest in piece, old friend.*

She made it into the alley, and ran a short way before coming to a
specific section of the wall. Three taps to find the right part, which
came away easily under her skilled hands. She looked around her as she
did, out of habit: She was confident no one was here, and that they
could not follow her this far. But still...

She still had *some* modesty.

She stripped off the dusty Theoran garb. *Wish it weren't so
bulky... But what are you gonna do?* Emptying her "findings" into the
bag, she stowed the thick garb in the wall, taking the time to seal it
back up before doing anything else. She stepped back, taking a long,
hard look at the wall... and nodded.

*Can't very well go around parading in my small-clothes...* She thought
 as she rummaged through her bag. She found a pair of pale pink
 breeches and an off-white tunic, which she hastily put on. Bag slung
 around her shoulders, she side-stepped the foul smelling puddle of
 wash water thrown from one of the windows, and walked out into the
 open.

*Moment of truth!* She thought as the sun shone softly on her
 terra-cotta brown skin. *If anyone saw me, they'll surely be on me
 now.* Taking a slow, deep breath, she began to stroll across the
 bustling square. The raucous sounds, flavorful smells, and
 claustrophobic feel of a busy market day washed over her as she
 casually walked into the thick of things.

She stopped here and there: Once to smell some flowers, and another to
 sit by a fountain and look around for a bit. *Can't have a repeat of
 Saulis... Gotta make sure I'm alone.* She took some money out of one
 of her pilfered purses and bought a bag of chyen, sipping it softly
 as she watched people rush this way and that.

About 10 minutes later, she decided she'd waited long enough. She
discarded the now empty bag, a new purpose in her steps as she made
her way to a specific alley off of the square. She stepped slowly down
the alley, careful not to draw any attention to herself: Third door on
the left, top floor after that.

She sighed as she opened the door, making sure it was fully closed
before turning a scowl at Baje as he welcomed her home.
