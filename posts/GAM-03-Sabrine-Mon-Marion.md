Sabrine Mon Marion, royal clerk of Liefeld and appointed guardian of
Jessica O Dacram, the foster child from the North, was about to knock
for the third and final time when the meager wooden door before her
finally gave way and opened as it should have minutes ago.

With an air of absent-minded, over-practiced politeness, her knees
bent in a curtsy as the door opened. Her lavishly decorated red and
gold dress graced the ground with the tip of its hem as her voice
echoed forth with all the pomp and circumstance she felt was due a
member of the royal court.

"Good *Morning*, dear Jessica. I *do* hope I'm not too *late*. You
wouldn't *believe* the nerve of the townsfolk this morning!" She had
her eyes closed as these words flew the roost of her mouth in one big
cloud. Straightening her knees, she brought her hands together and
opened her eyes. "How are *You* today?"

Xiska OdAkram, suffocating in her bandage-like green and gold dress,
managed to affect a smile. She opened her mouth as wide as she could,
letting out a resounding, "I am well. How are You?" in what (to her)
sounded like perfect Kingtongue.

She then tried her best to match the squatting motion of a curtsy, and
immediately fell over backwards.

Sabrine, with a look on her face that gave herself far too much credit
for the idea, took the moment to step forward and shut the door behind
her. Once she was sure that none could see them, she let the smile
fall from her face and placed a firm grasp on Xiska's arm. She pulled
with the strength of a frustrated parent in the middle of a
marketplace, fueled by embarrassment and indignation.

Xiska was jerked back up to her feet.

"*Jessica*, what are You *doing*?" Reproach dripped from her evenly
toned voice as she spoke. "I don't know what they do where *You* come
from, but a lady *never* falls to the floor in Liefeld! You're really
*lucky* we are in *private* right now!"

While being showered in Sabrine Mon Marion's torrent of reproach,
Xiska was brushing herself (Well, really, the clothes upon clothes
upon clothes covering her backside) off. Only when she had finished
did she turn and look up at Sabrine.

"Sorry, Sabrine," She softly said through clenched teeth. "I musta
fallen... I didn't mean it." Xiska's lavender eyes met with Sabrine's
green, which stared back expectantly for a few beats too many. Xiska
broke the gaze suddenly, and followed up.

"I am *sorry* Sabrine!" She repeated, twice as loud and
without the teeth.

"Oh, *Dear*, it is not the end of the *world* that You *fell*..."
Sabrine's loudly lilted way of speaking began again. "It's *just*... I
*worry* about You, You know? How You are *adjusting*, how You are
*feeling*... They *tell* me You haven't written home yet."

Setting her things on the nearby table, she shuffled some rolls of
parchment out of a long leather container, along with a brush and a
black vial that clinked against the wood. "Now, I know You aren't
*used* to our *ways* here, yet..." She began again, picking up the
vial. "But since we can't send sheets of *glass* by mail, You'll
*have* to resort to more *primitive* methods... like those used here,
in Liefeld."

The bulk of their meeting, Xiska then discovered, was to be about
writing to her family back North. She was told she could write in
whatever language she preferred... But, that this was a fine time to
practice the Kingstongue's writing, should she choose.

*So, it's better to write it **their** way, right?* Xiska thought to
herself. *Maybe I could ask for some help...* She eyed the black vial
of ink suspiciously. The smell that came out of it was vile, though
the marks it left on the paper (at least, those left by Sabrine,
anyway) were rather pretty, she had to admit.

The midday bell had just begun ringing when they were
finished. Sabrine, true to form, had had her things already packed and
ready to go by then. "So, have the missive *ready* for us next
week... and remember to practice Your *curtsy*!" A chuckle more
annoying than bugs flying past Your ear accompanied Sabrine's parting
curtsy as she spoke those final words.

Xiska let out a long sigh.

She was alone again, at last.
