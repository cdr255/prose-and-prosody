VERSE:
Two figures bookended a tower of wax,
outfacing the faces that they knew so well.
An old man was speaking his words, relaxed,
not wanting to show how his feelings now swelled.

He spoke in a language familiar to all,
no side 'round the tower would be at a loss.
And when he was finished and gave them the call
both figures might enter the realms of the moss.

CHORUS:
On one side was color, and sharpness, and sun,
she wore winged raiments with pomp and with pride,
on the other was moonlit, soft wool, colored dun,
she stood in his stead, for he had now died.

Both faces contorted deep under their masks
in worry that they would not make it through this.
They only remain because everyone asks
they settle this conflict born out of a kiss.

VERSE:
The old one approached them, fluttering slow
asking both in turn, would they be satisfied
with anything other than coming to blows
until one, the other, or both will have died.

This was the last chance, and they both new it well,
If either said yes they could both then be spared.
But life, they had learned, would expect them to dwell,
and so they both said they need now be paired.

CHORUS:
On one side was color, and sharpness, and sun,
she wore winged raiments with pomp and with pride,
on the other was moonlit, soft wool, colored dun,
she stood in his stead, for he had now died.

Both faces contorted deep under their masks
in worry that they would not make it through this.
They only remain because everyone asks
they settle this conflict born out of a kiss.

VERSE:
Resolved that all present needed to release
their anger and shame in a bout of violence
the elder removed from the field of green
he gave out the call, that the duel may commence.

CHORUS:
On one side was color, and sharpness, and sun,
she wore winged raiments with pomp and with pride,
on the other was moonlit, soft wool, colored dun,
she stood in his stead, for he had now died.

Both faces contorted deep under their masks
in worry that they would not make it through this.
They only remain because everyone asks
they settle this conflict born out of a kiss.

They only remain because everyone asks
