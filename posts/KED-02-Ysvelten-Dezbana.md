"Be True.
Be Yourself, First.
Then You can help others."
The words fell from her lips again
As she began to work instead of play
Another Friday night she spent
With needles and with hooks
Trying hard to
"Be True."

Wonder
Her mind wandered
Back, a trio of years
To when she'd have been out Friday,
One half of a duo of "being true."
Her hands a blur, her eyes one too,
she could not stand to think
And so she must
Wonder:

That night,
three years ago:
She fed her fish and left
to meet Dorisha by the lake
Once she was sure she was the last awake.
If she had stopped again to check...
she was so sure she should...
But she was late
that night.

Before,
She was alone
At night with Dorisha
They swam beneath the moon that night
No Clothes. That was the dare they gave themselves.
Of course they were found out that night.
It seemed like yesterday.
They'd been so mad,
Before.

Sorrow
A waterfall
which fed into a lake.
Dorisha had been reassigned.
Ysvelten never left her tools askew,
and so it was Dorisha's fault.
She'd work the capitol...
...*Two* years of great
Sorrow.

Be True:
Her mind wandered,
She fed her fish and left.
They swam beneath the moon that night,
Ysvelten never left her tools askew.
Of course they were found out that night.
She was so sure she should.
And so she must
Be True.
