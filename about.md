## About

Prose and Prosody is a [serial fiction][] website.

On a (semi-) regular basis, I upload short-form fiction to this
site. The little pieces, when taken together, tell a bigger
story. Once some of the stories are finished, I hope to publish them
somewhere after cleaning them up a bunch and formatting them as one
big story instead of many little episodic ones.

If You are familiar with webcomics at all, it's a *very* similar
idea. I hope to improve at my craft along the way, too, as many
webcomic artists/writers do, and I also hope that someone will be
interested in reading these someday (but, I'm mostly doing this
because I find personal value in creating these stories).

I started Prose and Prosody a few years ago as a little side project
that fell by the wayside when things got rough in my life. It's 2018,
I'm starting anew, and I want to do this thing again. Things will be
slow until I can build up a bit of a buffer (if I had a nickel
everytime I've read that sentence online, right?) but hopefully I can
keep a fairly regular schedule.
